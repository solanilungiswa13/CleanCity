**1. Test Strategy Development**
**Testing Scope and Objectives**

**In Scope:**

- Functional testing of all user flows (Home, Dashboard, Feedback, Awareness, Admin)
- Form validation and error handling
- UI/UX responsiveness across devices
- Accessibility testing for compliance
- Browser compatibility testing
- Data persistence via localStorage
- Intentional bug identification and documentation

**Out of Scope:**

- Backend API testing (uses localStorage)
- Performance testing under high load
- Security penetration testing
- Third-party integrations

**Test Objectives**

Validate all core waste management functionalities
Identify and document intentional flaws for learning purposes
Ensure responsive design across devices
Verify accessibility compliance
Test data persistence and CRUD operations

**2. Test Environment Setup**
**Browser Compatibility Matrix**

- Chrome (Version 100+)
- Firefox (Version 100+)
- Safari (Version 15+)
- Edge (Version 100+)

**Device Testing**

- Desktop: Windows 10/11, macOS, Linux
- Tablet: iPad, Android tablets
- Mobile: iPhone, Android phones

**Testing Tools**

- Manual Testing: Browser DevTools, Lighthouse
- Automated Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
- Accessibility: Screen readers, WAVE, axe-core
- Performance: Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools

**3. Known Intentional Flaws for Testing Practice**
**Critical Bugs to Identify**

1. Form Validation: Date field doesn't show validation error
2. Filtering Bug: Eldoret filter shows Nairobi requests instead
3. Accessibility: Missing alt-text on Awareness page images
4. Admin Panel: UI doesn't refresh after status updates
5. Input Handling: Layout issues with very long text inputs
